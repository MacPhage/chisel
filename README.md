###Chisel is an unfinished product and is currently in a pre-alpha stage. If you can code, feel free to contribute and speed up its development by making a commit or two to the project on Github.

####What is Chisel?
Chisel is a cross-platform desktop app for easy automation of common things that web developers do. Chisel, out of the box, automates tedious, annoying things like compiling, minifying, and concatenating. Rely on your text editor no longer!

Simply put, it's a easy-to-use tool that *will* save you time.

####Features
- Compiles LESS
- Minifies with UglifyJS 2
- Concatenates individual files
- Sleek UI
- Playful, fun, and easy to use
- Modular and expandable
- OS X, Linux, and even Windows support (see [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) for compatibility details)


####The Plan
Chisel is open-source, and will remain open-source. That means that anyone can contribute to the Chisel project, if they feel compelled to do so. In addition, Chisel will always be free. We hope that, when the time is right, we can release to the [Mac App Store](http://www.apple.com/osx/apps/app-store/) and [Microsoft Store](http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/list/Popular-apps-for-Windows-8/categoryID.67741000) to gain access to even more people that might find Chisel useful -- but that might take a while.

We want to make Chisel the best it can be.
